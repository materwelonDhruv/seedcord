- [ ] open dropdown in the sidebar is STILL FUCKING transparent. Can you delete the styling and code you have for the sidebar dropdown complete and try from scratch again. I feel that this is fully fucked. And keep it SIMPLE. We don't want any jazzy effects on the dropdown. Just that it matches the rest of the buttons.
- [ ] A bunch of items are randomly highlight in bright red in the search. Please fix. And actually, remove the pre-filled items from search all together. We only want to start showing results after the user has typed at least 3 characters
- [ ] I don’t like I there is a bright red outline in the search modal items container when I use arrow keys to navigate
- [ ] hover on the props and method item lists should not also change the color of the text in them. the bright red looks horrible
- [ ] get rid of that tiny “seedcord” text above the hero text on the landing page. Not needed.
- [ ] also get rid of the 3 cards on the hero page. We don’t need that feature. it’s clutter that’s not needed. I want to keep it simple. Now since you’re removing those cards, there will be extra space. So center it well.
- [ ] in mobile dimensions, the landing page, the seedcord big logo looks horrible when it centers itself below the hero text instead of the side. Instead of keeping it the same size and centering it, just have it become small and place itself beside the hero text maybe? or wherever it’s more logical to do so.
- [ ] when there aren’t enough items to justify a scroll in the sidebar, the div containers for the items get clipped on the right.
- [ ] similarly when there aren’t enough items to justify a scroll in the sidebar, and I try to scroll while my cursor is on that container, IT SCROLLS THE WHOLE DAMN PAGE. I told you to fix that before as well. It shouldn’t. Scrolling while cursor is inside the sidebar should NEVER affect scrolling ANYTHING else at all
- [ ] I can’t scroll the sidebar options while in mobile UI dimensions. It simply does not work.
- [ ] while in mobile UI, if I pull up the search modal, it’s clipped at the top.
- [ ] when I first start scrolling a docs page, the sidebar slightly moves up first, then freezes. Why? there some margin/padding issue? It should not move.
