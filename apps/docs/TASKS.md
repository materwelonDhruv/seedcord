- [ ] when I first start scrolling a docs page, the sidebar slightly moves up first, then freezes. To put it simply, the side bar as a whole should not be affected by scrolling at all. It should be fixed on the screen, and the height should be determined by the viewport height. And no matter what else scrolls on the page outside the sidebar, the sidebar should never move. (ofc, make sure to leave spacing above and below the sidebar so it doesn’t touch the edges of the viewport)
- [ ] when there aren’t enough items to justify a scroll in the sidebar, and I try to scroll while my cursor is on that container, IT SCROLLS THE WHOLE DAMN PAGE. Scrolling while cursor is hovering over the sidebar should NEVER affect scrolling ANYTHING else at all. It should simply not scroll anything if anything is not scrollable.
- [ ] There is a weird red outline when I hover over items in the package or version dropdown in the sidebar. Remove that.
- [ ] hover on the props and method item lists is a bit too subtle. Make it more a little more obvious.
- [ ] in mobile dimensions, the landing page, the seedcord logo looks so weird resized on the right. And it makes the hero text weirdly narrow. Just remove the logo when in mobile dimensions.
