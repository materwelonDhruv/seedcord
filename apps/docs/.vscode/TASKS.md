[ ] 50. The panel dropdowns for the constructor, or props, or methods for example, don't have a hover effect anymore and don't show a pointer cursor on hover.

[ ] 51. Settings clear doesn't have feedback on click. Maybe make a timed feedback button component.

[ ] 53. Scrollbar for the sidebar is perma-visible by default

[ ] 54. public abstract abstract public logger: Logger; - double abstract keyword in signature

[ ] 55. In the sidebar, when hovering over a package name, the tooltip shows the full package name but it has weird line breaks in it. It should be a single line with no breaks.

[ ] 56. Refactor all renaming styling across the project to use latest Tailwind features and reduce redundancy. Make

[ ] 42. Render @throws comment similar to Inherits from and See also sections. This is mostly done because we have a bunch of code and the types etc to handle it, but I don't see it rendered on the website. Also, please check kind-function-haspermstoassign.txt. You can see that it has an array for throws. Use the type from docs-engine package that's exported and access this array instead of looking for `@throws` tags.

[ ] 37. In type param rendered comments on entity pages, the type param comment duplicates itself above and below the signature.

[ ] 38. The param and typeparam section in methods below signature and above example can be a dropdown like examples. closed by default.

[ ] 41. Custom scroll bar that matches the seedcord theme for dark and light. Is sleek. And has transition when it appears/disappears. This should also be used in code blocks when overflowing for horizontal scroll.

[ ] 44. In tsdoc comments, if there are bullet points or numbered lists, (-, •, 1., 2., etc.), render them as actual lists in the rendered comments. Not just plain text with those characters.

[ ] 45. If a text is specifically a string (inside "" or '') in the signature of any entity, don't attempt to hyperlink it. Because right now for example, `type LifecycleAction = "start" | "complete" | "error"`, the "error" is hyperlinked to the mdn Error page.

[ ] 46. Something about tooltips in the sidebar feels off. Also, tooltips in general across the app. Lets use the tooltip component from that ui library we're using, but make our own custom component using it so we have consistent styling. I don't like how the tooltips are transparent background. So first thing is fixing that.

[ ] 47. Browser navigation popup on mobile doesn't close when I click an option in it. Also, when scrolling in this popup on mobile, the scroll doesn't keep scrolling when I lift my finger. It stops immediately. It should have some momentum.

[ ] 48. Rendering for virtual and remarks.

[ ] 49. Render markdown in comments.
