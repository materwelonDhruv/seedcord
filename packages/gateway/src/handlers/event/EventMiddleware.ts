/**
 * Base class for Discord event middleware.
 *
 * Middleware runs before event handlers and can stop the event by throwing a `Silence`. Unlike `EventHandler`, it
 * runs the SAME for every event it is registered for, so it has no `match`. Specify a single event in the
 * generic and `{ events }` to read `this.event` fully typed. Span several events (or omit `{ events }` for a
 * catchall) and `this.event` narrows to `never`, read `this.eventName` and do work that does not depend on the
 * payload shape. A middleware that needs each event's payload is written one event per class.
 *
 * @typeParam EventName - One or more `ClientEvents` keys. Defaults to every event (catchall).
