 * Base class for a Discord autocomplete handler.

 * with `this.options`, and find which command fired with `this.route`.

 * @typeParam Route - One or more route keys from {@link SlashRegistry}, e.g. `'search'` or `'search' | 'find'`.
 * @typeParam Cache - The interaction cache state. The command's contexts set it.

 * ```ts
 * \@AutocompleteRoute('search')
 * class SearchAutocomplete extends AutocompleteHandler<'search'> {
 *     async execute() {
 *         await this.match({
 *             query: (value, respond) => respond([{ name: value, value }])
