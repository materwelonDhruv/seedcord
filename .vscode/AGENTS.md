- DO NOT try to lint or run scripts unless it's absolutely needed to complete the given task.
- DO NOT run `pnpm lint`. ALWAYS run `pnpm lint:fix` instead.
- ALWAYS, I repeat, ALWAYS first cd into the package or app's directory, then run the command via pnpm.
- For most eslint issues, after you make multiple file changes, just run lint:fix regularly instead of trying to fix each file individually. eslint will let you know if there are any remaining issues.
- If the linter it executes without finding any problems and youâ€™re done with all tasks, just proceed to the summary section.
- Run only the commands available in the package or app's package.json scripts.
- At the end of your response, always include a summary of changes made in the files.
- The user is watching you change the files. If they see lint errors, they'll save the file which will auto-fix issues. In that case, just move on instead of getting stuck in a loop trying to fix errors that don't exist anymore.
- DO NOT edit AGENTS.md or TASKS.md unless explicitly told to do so.
- The user has tsx installed globally. so you can simply cd into the correct directory and run `tsx file.ts`
- Always follow DRY and SOLID principles.
