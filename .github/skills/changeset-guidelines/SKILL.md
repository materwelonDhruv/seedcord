description: Use this when writing or reviewing a changeset in `.changeset/*.md`. Covers how behavior decides the release type, the opening word for a bug fix, and how much of a mechanism one sentence should carry, drawn from a real review where one changeset needed ten corrections before it shipped.

# Changesets

A changeset becomes a changelog entry, which someone scans while deciding whether an upgrade breaks their bot. Get the release type right first, then say what changed once, in the reader's own case.

This skill decides what a changeset says. `writing-voice` covers how any sentence in this repo sounds. `release-version` covers cutting the release itself.

---

## 1. Behavior decides the release type

Ask whether a running bot behaves differently after the upgrade. Never ask whether the types still compile. Pre-1.0 in this repo, a yes answer means a `minor` bump carrying the bold `**BREAKING:**` prefix.

A durable store keyed on the old behavior changes silently. In the worked example below, every persisted cooldown window reset on upgrade, and nothing in the build said so.

---

## 2. Open with what kind of entry this is

A bug fix opens with `Fixed`. A second fix in the same changeset opens its own sentence with `Also fixed`.

Why: a changelog gets scanned, so the first word has to say what kind of entry this is.

---

## 3. Write the reader's own case

```md
BAD: "a handler registered on several routes"
GOOD: "a handler registered on two buttons"
```

Why: the reader matches the entry against their own code. "Several" makes them do that work themselves.

---

## 4. Name the mechanism once

Never list the fields it touched.

```md
BAD: "`interactionDispatched.routeId`, `responseAttempted.routeId`, and the dispatch bag used to carry every route the class declares"
GOOD: "its route id joined both into `button:confirm,cancel`"
```

Why: a field list restates the diff. One sentence about the mechanism covers all of them.

---

## 5. Run cause into effect

Keep a thread between sentences.

```md
BAD: "Clicking one used to put both on cooldown. Each gets its own instead."
GOOD: "Because its route id joined both into `button:confirm,cancel`, clicking either one put both on cooldown."
```

Why: splitting every clause to dodge connectors leaves stubs, and the reader has to rebuild the relation you dropped.

---

## 6. Match the connector to the relation

```md
BAD: ", and now each has its own"
GOOD: "instead", or a fronted "Because ..."
```

`and` means "also". Here the second half replaces the first.

Why: the wrong connector asserts a relation that is not there.

---

## 7. Give a value a job

```md
BAD: "Each gets its own instead, `button:confirm`."
GOOD: "Now it would just be `button:confirm`, for example."
```

Why: an id hanging off a comma has nothing to attach to, so it reads as debris.

---

## 8. Mark an illustrative value as illustrative

```md
BAD: "The id now reads `button:confirm`."
GOOD: "Now it would just be `button:confirm`, for example."
```

Why: the real value depends on which route matched. Stated flat, it reads as the only value.

---

## 9. Stop once the reader can derive the rest

```md
BAD: "The id now reads `button:confirm`, so each button keeps its own."
GOOD: "Now it would just be `button:confirm`, for example."
```

Why: the previous sentence already said both went on cooldown. Narrowing the id makes the consequence the reader's next thought.

---

## 10. Fix the wording, keep the fact

```md
BAD: deleting both example ids because the word "instead" appeared twice
```

Why: the ids are the greppable part. A repeated word is the cheaper thing to change.

---

## The worked example

One real change, a `Cooldown` keyed a route id that a two-button handler shared. First draft through final.

First draft, rejected:

```md
**BREAKING:** A handler registered on several routes now reports the route that matched. `interactionDispatched.routeId`, `responseAttempted.routeId`, and the dispatch bag used to carry every route the class declares, joined with commas. A `Cooldown` on such a handler runs one window per route.
```

Middle draft, rejected. The maintainer said "I had to read it multiple times over":

```md
Fixed one click cooling down every route on a handler that covers several. The dispatch id now names the route that matched, `button:confirm` where it used to read `button:confirm,cancel`.
```

Accepted:

```md
**BREAKING:** Fixed the cooldown on a handler registered on two buttons. Because its route id joined both into `button:confirm,cancel`, clicking either one put both on cooldown. Now it would just be `button:confirm`, for example.
```

This skill decides what a changeset says. Those two decide how the words sound and how the release runs.
